This example uses calculate windows with DS2 and pattern windows to process sensor readings from wind turbines.
<br/><br/>
The event data should begin to flow when the project is loaded. You can pause and restart the event flow with the link
at the top center of the page.
<br/><br/>
The page subscribes to the turbine data and displays the current values in the turbine widgets. It also subscribes to the
turbine alerts window. When a new turbine alert is received, the corresponding widget will turn red and the turbine will
stop spinning for about 5 seconds. It will then go back to normal.
