This example pushes stock trade data through an ESP model looking for trade violations.
<br/><br/>
The violation data displayed includes the following:
<dl class="indent">
<li>Gauges displaying the total amount of violations committed by each broker.</li>
<li>A map and table showing the amount of violations occurring at each trading venue.</li>
<li>A table showing min, max, and average trade prices for high volume symbols (over 100 trades).</li>
<li>A time series chart showing the event processing rates for both total and interval.</li>
<li>Gauges showing total events processed and current interval rate.</li>
<li>Gauges displaying the amount of violations by type.</li>
</dl>
When you load the page, it will load the project into the ESP server. Upon a successful load,
a publisher will read the 1 million trades from <a href="trades.txt" target="_blank">trades.txt</a>
and send them to the server.
<br/><br/>
Since the page is both sending 1 million events and processing the results it is very busy. The
event rates will fluctuate with the heavy processing over the million events.
