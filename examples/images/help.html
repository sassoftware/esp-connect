This example allows you to specify a video to play. The page will grab each frame from the video and publish it into the ESP model. The example
uses binary communication with the ESP server so it can keep up with the rate and amount of data being processed.
<br/><br/>
In order to run the model, you must copy the <a href="../data/images.astore">astore file</a>
into the directory in which you are running your ESP server.
<br/><br/>
<b>NOTE:</b> Since the astore file is a generic one, the image detection will not be as accurate when applied to random video files.
<br/><br/>
After you have done this, you can hit the play icon and start the video. As the video starts, each frame is grabbed and copied into the HTML
canvas element at the upper right of the screen. Then, the image data is taken out of the canvas and sent into the ESP image processing object detection
model. The image is processed and sent back to the web page where it is displayed in the <i>Results</i> image viewer.
