This example is taken from the standard set of ESP examples
<br/><br/>
This example shows how you can use SAS Event Stream Processing Streamviewer to visualize an event stream of data obtained from a set of boats. The model 
identifies two geographical areas of interest. One area is an exclusion zone that the boats identified are not permitted to enter. The other is an area 
where a speed restriction has been applied. For convenience, it is recommended that you upload the preprepared model XML file to SAS Event Stream Processing Studio.
<br/><br/>
For demonstration purposes, this example uses CSV files containing historical data. When a model similar to the one used in this example is deployed in a live 
environment, real-time data sources might be used instead. Before attempting to follow the steps in this example to create a sailing data dashboard, ensure that 
the model is working correctly in test mode. This includes ensuring that the model’s publisher connectors are correctly configured. The CSV files 
listed previously must be in a location on the server on which SAS Event Stream Processing is running
<br/><br/>

This example uses six files listed below:
<ol>
<li>The XML file (sailing_example.xml) is the project used in the example.</li>
<li>geoArea.csv is an input file. This file contains events relating to the defined areas of interest.</li>
<li>boat1.csv is an input file. This file contains the event stream of boat 1. The event stream contains time-stamped geographical coordinates of the boat’s movements.</li>
<li>boat2.csv is an input file. This file contains the event stream of boat 2. The event stream contains time-stamped geographical coordinates of the boat’s movements.</li>
<li>boat3.csv is an input file. This file contains the event stream of boat 3. The event stream contains time-stamped geographical coordinates of the boat’s movements.</li>
<li>boat4.csv is an input file. This file contains the event stream of boat 4. The event stream contains time-stamped geographical coordinates of the boat’s movements.</li>
</ol>

The ESP model contains the following windows:

<ol>
<li>Four Source windows that receive event streams from the four boats identified: The Mayflower, The Bounty, The Beagle, and The Santa Maria.</li>
<li>One Source window that receives an event stream defining the areas of interest that the boats are not permitted to enter: Areas_Of_Interest.</li>
<li>One Geofence window that defines the areas of interest: Geofence_Area_Check.</li>
<li>One Copy window that is used to transition the model from stateless to stateful.</li>
<li>Two Filter windows that identify if any of the boats have entered the exclusion zone and speed restriction zone and if any of the boats were 
speeding: Filter_Inside_Exclusion_Zone and Last_Speeding_Event</li>
<li>Two Aggregate windows that aggregate the last exclusion violation and the last speeding event: Last_Exclusion_Violation and Last_Speeding_Event</li>
</ol>
