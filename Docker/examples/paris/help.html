This example simulates vehicles traveling through Paris. The example adds several general polygons and some specific points of interest to the map. When the vehicles enter and/or
approach these items, you will see events come in. Also, the speed and direction of the vehicles are displayed in gauges and compasses, respectively. You can initiate any number
of vehicle trips by hitting the gear icon at the top right and entering a vehicle name.
